## üìã Overview

Urban parking spaces face fluctuating demand throughout the day, leading to issues of overcrowding or underutilization if static pricing is applied.  
This project develops an **intelligent dynamic pricing system** for 14 urban parking lots using **real-time data streams**, leveraging machine learning models and economic theory to set optimal parking prices.

The system updates prices based on:
- Occupancy rates
- Queue lengths
- Nearby traffic conditions
- Special events or holidays
- Type of incoming vehicles
- Competitor parking prices (optional in advanced models)

The solution ensures **smooth, explainable price variations** and offers optional vehicle rerouting recommendations.
